The analysis was conducted using SAS Visual Analytics and includes various visualizations to understand accident patterns, causes, and mitigation strategies.
## Repository Structure
- `/data` - Contains raw and processed datasets used in the analysis.
- `/sas_scripts` - SAS code for data processing and visualization.
- `/reports` - Generated reports in PDF and XML format.
- `/visualizations` - Graphs, charts, and maps derived from the analysis.
- `/docs` - Documentation on methodology, assumptions, and findings.

## Data Source
The dataset was sourced from SAS Visual Analytics and covers traffic accident records from 2015-2017 across 12 provinces. The data includes information on offenders, accident types, casualty counts, and associated factors.
