# Traffic Accidents Analysis - SAS Report

## Project Overview
This repository contains SAS-based data exploration reports on traffic accidents across multiple provinces, identifying potential offenders and accident trends. The analysis was conducted using SAS Visual Analytics and includes various visualizations to understand accident patterns, causes, and mitigation strategies.
## Repository Structure
- `/data` - Contains raw and processed datasets used in the analysis.
- `/sas_scripts` - SAS code for data processing and visualization.
- `/reports` - Generated reports in PDF and XML format.
- `/visualizations` - Graphs, charts, and maps derived from the analysis.
- `/docs` - Documentation on methodology, assumptions, and findings.

## Data Source
The dataset was sourced from SAS Visual Analytics and covers traffic accident records from 2015-2017 across 12 provinces. The data includes information on offenders, accident types, casualty counts, and associated factors.

## Key Findings
- Zuid-Holland had the highest number of hit-and-run cases (551).
- Casualty rates increased in September, with the highest accident occurrences in November.
- Intoxicated drivers and uninsured vehicles are major contributors to accidents.
- Accidents peaked at **5:00 PM**, with intoxicated driving incidents more frequent at **2:00 AM, 7:00 PM, and 11:00 PM**.

## How to Reproduce the Report
1. Ensure you have **SAS Visual Analytics 8.5.1** installed.
2. Load the dataset into SAS.
3. Run the scripts in `/sas_scripts/` to generate visualizations.
4. Export the final report from SAS Visual Analytics.
